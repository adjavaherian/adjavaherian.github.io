            Good question. I've got plenty of experience as a full stack
            developer with nearly two decades of work under my belt. I'm
            expecting to graduate from the MS CIS program this next Spring, and
            I've got three electives to take, so I decided to take 601 as a
            refresher and a way to experience the academic side of what we do
            professionally. I think this course will better prepare me to be a
            mentor to junior developers. I might even try to become a teaching
            assistant one day, so actually taking the course is probably the
            best preparation. Also, its fun, you'd be surprised how little time
            I have to do things like code up a portfolio site for myself or get
            to the very fundamentals of web development. I think this experience
            will only serve to make me a more well rounded engineer. I consider
            this class to provide some insight into the academic norms of modern
            web development. I'm excited to hear lectures from Jen Looper, who
            is very knowlegeable about academic and professional development.
            Who knows I might even use some of this learning in my next
            interview.

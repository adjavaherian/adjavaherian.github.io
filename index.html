            You may know me from some movies, like "Strugglin; The
            Struggle is Real", or "Struggle Bus 2; Dad's hair is all gone!"
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_McClure" target="_blank">Troy McClure</a> jokes aside, I'm a forty something developer. I currently work for
            Major League Baseball as one of the Principal Engineers for
            &nbsp;<a href="https://www.mlb.com" target="_blank">mlb.com</a>. I'm
            broadly responsible keeping the site running. We serve around a
            hundred million baseball fans every year! When I'm not serving
            baseball fans, you can find me working on some DIY projects in the
            Garage. I've also been in a few bands and written a few songs. I'm
            an avid guitar player and like wordsmithing some pop-y folk songs
            from time to time.

                    Good question. We're ususally busy with work, or cooking or
                    cleaning.

                    I was lucky enough to be able to work remotely. I work for MLB

                    My wife is a Chicago native, so we thought it would be good
                    for the kids to grow up with more family around.
